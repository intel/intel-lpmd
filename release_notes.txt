pkg.OPT.HEPO release notes
package name: pkg.OPT.HEPO-0.05.240605-x86_64
tag: pkg-hepo-0.05.240605
ww: 23.3

Support Ubuntu distro 22.04 and 24.04
fix the app relaunching issue (failed to launch at the second or third time launching, see previous release notes)
reduce the log
AC/DC detection works and it shall show the battery workload type

Installation changes:
1) tuned is no longer a dependency in .deb installation
2) .deb installation will copy the .tar.gz file to /usr/share/ia_pkg/hepo and untar there 
3) .deb installation will run ./deploy.sh from /usr/share/ia_pkg/hepo/pkg.OPT.HEPO.xxx 
4) .deb uninstallation will run ./rollback.sh from /usr/share/ia_pkg/hepo/pkg.OPT.HEPO.xxx 
5) The installation will check the status of ppd (power-profiles-daemon):
	If ppd is inactive, the installation will install tuned (if not installed) and start tuned profile to run intel_lpmd 
	If ppd is active, the installation will only install intel_lpmd as a system service (sudo systemctl status intel_lpmd) and not touching ppd and tuned
